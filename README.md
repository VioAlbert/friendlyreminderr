# Friendly Reminder

Friendly reminder is a LINE Bot Project. As the bot's name suggests, Friendly Reminder functions as a ToDo reminder, where you can ask him to remind you what to do next by sending "Hello Reminder?"

Currently, this bot is targeted to serve only <b>a specific LINE Group</b> which identity we won't tell.
